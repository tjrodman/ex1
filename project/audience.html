        <p>I created a persona based on several current UC Davis Freshman. The persona, Kimmy Nappa, is a first-year student, 18 years old, majoring in Environmental Sciences. She enjoys watching netflix, eating out, playing basketball, watching sports, and playing guitar. She is not too focused on finding her passion in life because she figures she will discover more about herself as time passes. Kimmy spends 10 hours a week browsing through the internet, and 20 hours doing school-related work. Kimmy also uses social media apps such as twitter, facebook, snapchat, instagram, and messenger, and she spends about 5 hours a week on these cellular apps. This personal will be used to model my website to cater to the needs of the average UC Davis Freshman.</p>
