        <p>During the storyboard activity, I got to plan out how a user would approach my website with various scenarios such as registering for classes as a new, incoming student and a student preparing for the upcoming quarter. The process was extremely helpful because it put me in the shoes of my target audience. My feedback was mostly positive and my group partners commented that it accurately portrayed the process of registering for classes as a new and continuing student. Furthermore, seeing other people’s storyboards was interesting to see other students’ work and how they were going to cater to their users’ needs.</p>
