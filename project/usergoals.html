    </header>

    <section class='bodyText'>
        <h2>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h2>
        <p>Titles of each section will be clearly shown, each category of first-year seminars will have various media such as videos or photos to show more about certain classes. These forms of media relate to students better than long descriptions provided by UC Davis administration.</p>
        <h2>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h2>
        <p>The various forms of media that showcase various unique aspects of fys will motivate the user to research more about these classes. The basic purpose and objective is inspiring individuals to get involved in these unique classes and they can do so by navigating through a website that is visually modern, interactive, and designed for them as first year students.</p>
        <h2>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h2>
        <p>The users need a basic overview of what freshman seminars are, descriptions of each category, videos and pictures taken during these classes so the user can see what itâ€™s like to be in this experience.</p>
        <h2>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are 
their experience levels with the type of media you or your team is creating?</h2>
        <p>Most young users of internet apps are familiar with responsive design as they have access to iphone, ipad, and website apps. They are used to having access to high quality images and videos and well-organized website layouts as the modern websites tend to be used by young adults.
