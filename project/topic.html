        <p>Topic Choice: Creating a website to help improve UC Davis undergraduate experience.</p>
        <p>I will be creating a website that will inspire and motivate freshman to learn more about Freshman Seminars, or first-year seminars (fys), offered at UC Davis. Students will be able to navigate through general categories of the websites and view past videos of other studentsâ€™ experience at each course. This website will be written and displayed in a style that keeps some aspects of the UC Davis style, but gives character and main focus to the Freshman Seminar courses. This new design will have information that will better relate to UC Davis Freshmen, who are transitioning into college.
